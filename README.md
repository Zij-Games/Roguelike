## Bashing Bytes

So this is mainly to just work on my ability to have a long term project, and to just have fun with Rust. The main goal of this project is to make an accessilbe roguelike that anyone could play. I would like the game to support just using the mouse, or just the keyboard. For now the asthetics aren't the primary goal, although I would like it to look nice. This does mean that before I make the game something different (whatever that means), that I would like to make sure its fun to just explore the menus. 

Currently the game does not support a tile setup. I plan on changing this at some point in the future, because if the data from AMOD/Cogmind can be reasonably applied to any roguelike, 80% of players will use the tileset, and not the ascii graphics.

The library I am using for the heavy-lifting is the [bracket library](https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib). The github page also has a link to the tutorial, which this project is based on. I plan on following it in order to build up my algorithm repetoire, and help where my creativity is lacking. 

# State of Game

Game is back to being in a playable, non-testing state. Still not the most interesting of games, but its mine.

# Current Goals
- [ ] Feedback (animations)
- [ ] Accessibility (Color options / Keyboard and/or Mouse playability) 
- [ ] Procedurally generated map
- [ ] One ranged based enemy

# Completed Goals
- [x] One melee based enemy
- [x] Health
- [x] Combat
- [x] A map

As I mark off goals, I will add new ones, but this is a good starting point for now.

# Feedback
If you see something in my code that looks messy and should be improved, please do let me know by submitting a PR!
