## Roguelike

So this is mainly to just work on my ability to have a long term project, and to just have fun with Rust. This project will have some goals, but they will shift as I get more or less time to work on the project. [the bracket library](https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib)

# Current Goals
- [ ] Procedurally generated map
- [ ] One melee based enemy
- [ ] One ranged based enemy
- [ ] Health
- [ ] Combat

As I mark off goals, I will add new ones, but this is a good starting point for now.

# Feedback
If you see something in my code that looks messy and should be improved, please do let me know by submitting a PR!
