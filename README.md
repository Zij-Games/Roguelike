## Roguelike

So this is mainly to just work on my ability to have a long term project, and to just have fun with Rust. This project will have some goals, but they will shift as I get more or less time to work on the project. The library I am using for the heavy-lifting is the [bracket library](https://github.com/thebracket/bracket-lib)

# Current Goals
- [ ] Procedurally generated map
- [x] One melee based enemy
- [ ] One ranged based enemy
- [x] Health
- [x] Combat

As I mark off goals, I will add new ones, but this is a good starting point for now.

# Feedback
If you see something in my code that looks messy and should be improved, please do let me know by submitting a PR!
